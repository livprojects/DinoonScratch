Hi there! 
This is a short game made with MIT Scratch (https://scratch.mit.edu/). It's part of a problem set designed by Harvard's CS50. 
Specifics can be found here: https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/psets/0/
In this game, you control a dinosaur with the arrows of your keyboard and your goal is to avoid meteors falling on Earth.
